## Weather App 

When Starting this this project, I frist mapped out a plan of the things I need to add for my forcast. As I was planning started with the thing I would need frist. So I made to HTML frist with all the elements that would be needed, I did this by adding bootstrap to the head of my HTML. Then I used their documentation, to add the different features that would be need like a nav bar and an input field/ button. This would allow me to add event lister to the button and I also made empty containers for the weather
